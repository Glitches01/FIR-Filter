# FIR-Filter

## Description  
**Project Structure:**  
- `./dc` - Design Compiler synthesis  
- `./docs` - Algorithms and datapath diagram  
- `./matlab` - Coefficient and data input generation, also serves as the golden verification reference  
- `./qsim_dc` - Final simulation, post-synthesis  
- `./rtl` - Verilog code for the FIR filter

### Simple Start  
A Simple FIR Filter  
- Code written in RTL Verilog  
- Verified by ModelSim and Formal methods  
- Synthesizable code style  
- Synthesized using Design Compiler
